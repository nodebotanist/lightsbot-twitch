# Getting the Hardware Started

## Materials List

1. An ESP8266 board (I use the SparkFun ESP8266 Dev Thing, but any esp8266-12 board should do the trick)
1. A strand of WS2812 addressable RGB LEDs (known as neopixel on/thanks to Adafruit)
1. A WiFi connection of the 2.4 gHz variety (5 gHz will not be usable by the esp8266)
